# Project Title

ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course Assessment â€“ "Getting Started with Solidity"

## Description

a detailed paragraph outlining your idea and its intended purpose.

We were given the responsibility of creating our own token in theory for this exam. in addition to a few specifications that help us determine what the application should look like.

## Getting Started

The program is written in Solidity and developed using the Remix IDE. The token class is named "MyToken" and includes the following public variables:
- TokenName
- tokenAbbr
- totalSupply
The program also implements required functionalities, including mint and burn functions, to modify the token supply.

## Installation

To execute the program:

Use the Remix IDE or any Solidity-compatible IDE.
No modifications to the code or folder structure are required.

## How to Run the Program

Copy the script and paste it into Remix IDE (or any IDE that supports Solidity).

Compile and deploy the contract.

Copy your account address and paste it into the _address fields of the burn, mint, and balances functions.

To mint tokens:
  -Enter a value in the _value field.
  -Click the totalSupply button to verify the updated supply.
 To burn tokens:
  -Enter a value in the _value field of the burn function.
  -Click the totalSupply button to confirm the reduced supply.
To check token details:
  -Click tokenAbbr for the abbreviation or TokenName for the name.
Note: If the burn value exceeds the supply, the supply remains at zero.
